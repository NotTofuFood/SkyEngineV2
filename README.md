The above photo demonstrates floor rendering, ceiling rendering, diagonal walls, and multi-textured walls.

# COMING THINGS IN FUTURE UPDATES

- Full realtime audio that takes in account the sceneray, in order to give off a realistic audio playback
- "2D Raytracing" to make a lightmap for the scene, giving off very nice lighting from the walls
- Doors
- "Triggers" that can be used in the editor in order to trigger certain events, or check for certain events
- Revamping the current editor for making maps and porting the editor over to JavaScript.

# KNOWN BUGS

- Wonky Collisions
- Entities sometimes flicker
- Coordinate out of bounds error thrown by SceneManager.Java (has no effect on gameplay and is thrown by the floor for loop)
- Camera moves weirdly when trying to go forward/backward sometimes (Slightly Fixed)
- Images won't export in the .jar file
